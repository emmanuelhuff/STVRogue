This is a group project done by Buse Guldiken, Emmanuel Huff, Jina Lee and Chris Sclipei while studying abroad in the Netherlands. 
Created a terminal-based game in which the user would traverse a dungeon, created by a graph, and encounter monsters to fight. The objective of this project was to reach the end of the dungeon. The user could pick up and use items and also flee attacks if they encounter a monster.
