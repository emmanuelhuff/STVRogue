This is a group porject done by Buse Guldiken, Emmanuel Huff, Jina Lee and myself while studying aborad in the Netherlands. 
Created a terminal-based game in which the user would traverse a dungeon, created by a graph, and encounter monsters to fight. The objective of this project was to reach the end of the dungeon. The user could pick up and use items and also flee attacks if they encounter a monster. 
This code isn't completely finished since we have a few issues we need to polish.
